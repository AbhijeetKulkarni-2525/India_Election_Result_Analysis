## Project Overview: India_Election_Result_Analysis

This project analyzes election data from various constituencies and states. The SQL queries aim to calculate the number of seats, track electoral results, and analyze the performance of political alliances and individual parties. The analysis includes the distribution of seats, votes, and other critical insights related to election outcomes.

### Steps Performed:

- **Dataset Exploration:**
  - Retrieve the raw data from tables like `constituencywise_details`, `constituencywise_results`, `partywise_results`, `states`, and `statewise_results` to explore and understand the available data.

- **Total Seats Analysis:**
  - Calculate the total number of seats in the constituency and find out how many seats are available in each state for elections.

- **Seat Distribution by Alliance:**
  - Calculate the total number of seats won by the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) and I.N.D.I.A. (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance).
  - Calculate the seats won by each party within the NDA and I.N.D.I.A. alliances.

- **Party-wise Performance:**
  - Find the total number of seats won by each party, both in the NDA and I.N.D.I.A. alliances.
  - Identify which party has won the most seats in each alliance.

- **Election Results by Constituency:**
  - Retrieve the name of the winning candidate, party, total votes, and margin of victory for a specific constituency (e.g., 'PUNE').

- **Vote Type Distribution:**
  - Analyze the distribution of EVM (Electronic Voting Machine) votes versus postal votes for candidates in a particular constituency (e.g., 'NASHIK').

- **Seats Won by Party in State:**
  - Find out how many seats each party has won in a specific state (e.g., 'Andhra Pradesh').

- **Seats Won by Alliance in State:**
  - Analyze the total number of seats won by each alliance (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., or Other) in a specific state (e.g., 'Rajasthan').

- **Alliance-wise Seat Distribution Across States:**
  - Show the distribution of seats won by each alliance (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., Other) for each state, allowing a state-by-state comparison.

- **Top Candidates by EVM Votes:**
  - Identify the top 10 candidates who received the highest number of EVM votes, along with their constituencies.

- **Winner and Runner-Up by Constituency:**
  - Find the winner and first runner-up for each constituency in a given state (e.g., 'Tamil Nadu'), ranked by total votes received.

- **Comprehensive Election Data for a State:**
  - For a specific state (e.g., 'Maharashtra'), calculate:
    - Total number of seats.
    - Total number of candidates.
    - Total number of parties.
    - Total votes (both EVM and postal votes).
    - Breakdown of EVM and postal votes.
